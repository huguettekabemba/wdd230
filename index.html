        <p>Hello! My name is Nsamba but most of the time I prefer kabemba.
          I am married to my eternal companion Nourcel and We have a wonderful daughter.
          I am from Republic Democratic of Congo(DRC), but currently we are living in Cape Town, South  Africa. 
          The weather here is nice but sometimes it is very cold.</p>
      
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 17 years now.
        Things I love about the Church are the organization.</p>
      
        <p>Actually I am not working. I am pursuing a degree in computer science Web Designer Developer.
        I love Technology especially creating beautiful web sites and want to improve my skills so that I can get a job.</p> 
      
        <p>The things I love to do are listening to music, watching movies and show.
           That is all I can say to you about me. Thank you for consulting my web page.</p>
