                <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

                <p>The Visual Hierarchy principle is use to show the importance of each page/screen's contents by manipulating these characteristics(the size and color)so i think this website uses the visual hierarchy because it shows Things that we are meant to see first in large because user notice large element easily and also the and bright colors typically attract more attention than muted ones.</p>

                <p>Hick's law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) principle helps users to simplify their decision-making process. A simple idea says that the more choices you present your users with, the longer it will take them to reach a decision. So for me I think the Ackermans website is a good example of hick's law design principle. Because by categorizing the items it is Enabling users to not spend a lot of time looking for what they need.

                <p>The principle of proximity states that items close together are likely to be perceived as part of the same group.The principle of parc proximity is exemplified on this site by calling for related items to be grouped visually, creating less clutter and making for a more organized layout. Items unrelated to each other should be placed further apart, to emphasize their lack of relationship.
